linter-lua-globals
==================

> luac â€” The luac program parses lua files. It can be used for detecting errors in lua code. See [http://www.lua.org/manual/4.0/luac.html](http://www.lua.org/manual/4.0/luac.html) for more informations about luac.

This package will lint your `.lua` opened files in Atom using a script to find globals.  **It will lint on edit and/or save**, so you'll see instantly if your code has globals you may not be expecting.

The script provided was created originally by [Mikk](http://www.wowace.com/addons/findglobals/)

##Directives in the file:
The following directives in the file turn certain features off in the detection

-- GLOBALS: SomeGlobal, SomeOtherGlobal
  The script will never complain about these. There may be multiple lines of these anywhere in the file, taking effect globally (for now). There is no way to un-GLOBAL an already declared global.

-- SETGLOBALFILE [ON/OFF]
  Enable/disable SETGLOBAL checks in the global scope
  Default: ON
  
-- SETGLOBALFUNC [ON/OFF]
  Enable/disable SETGLOBAL checks in functions. This setting affects the whole file (for now)
  Default: ON
  
-- GETGLOBALFILE [ON/OFF]
  Default: OFF

-- GETGLOBALFUNC [ON/OFF]
  Default: ON
